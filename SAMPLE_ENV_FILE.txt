# You can specify these two keys location like this, where the target file
# solely contains the key like "sk-xxxxxx"
# This is the RECOMMENDED way to use the keys especially if you plan to expose
# the app to the public through a VPS, etc. (so you can chmod the actual keys to 400 or sth)

```
OPENROUTER_API_KEY_PATH=/put/absolute/path/to/your/openrouter_api_key
OPENAI_API_KEY_PATH=/put/absolute/path/to/your/openai_api_key
```


# Alternatively, you can specify the keys directly like this (not recommended for production)

```
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxx
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxx
```

# If you wish, you can change the "domicile country" and "language" (in natural language)
# and the currency in string (Symbol works best).
# This is NOT the navigation language, but is where you will use the app (do shopping)
# The app is not meant to change currency midway. (will need to add a migration function for it, may add)
# English will always be used for navigation, as well as the AI analysis, since LLMs work best in English most of the time.
# Leave the DOMICILE_LANGUAGE empty if you want English.

```
DOMICILE_COUNTRY=Italy
DOMICILE_LANGUAGE=Italian
CURRENCY=â‚¬
